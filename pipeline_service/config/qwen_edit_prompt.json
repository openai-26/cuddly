    "positive": "Transform this object into a perfect, high-quality 3D-ready image. Present the object in a clear three-quarters view showing maximum detail and depth. Reconstruct and restore any lost details, missing parts, or incomplete sections with photorealistic accuracy. Enhance and refine all textures with proper material characteristics - add realistic surface details, depth, and material finishes (wood grain, metal shine, fabric weave, etc.). Correct any color inaccuracies and ensure accurate, vibrant color reproduction. Fix distorted shapes and restore proper proportions. Sharpen all edges and fine details including decorative elements, carvings, moldings, patterns, and ornamental features. Add realistic lighting and shadows to emphasize three-dimensional form and depth. Remove any watermarks, text, or artifacts. Place object on a flat, uniform, neutral solid-color background (white, light gray, or complementary color) that clearly separates the object from the background. Ensure the entire object is fully visible with no cropping. Ultra-high fidelity, photorealistic, production-ready result optimized for 3D model generation.",
